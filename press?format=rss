Wells</a>, co-founder and co-director of Plan C, an organization that advocates for self-managed abortion care and medication abortion pill access. Aid Access and other&nbsp;<a href="https://plancpills.org/reportcard" target="_blank">online providers</a>&nbsp;have been a&nbsp;reliable resource for patients as some states become increasingly hostile to abortion rights. “Aid Access has been a real safety net and now they aren’t able to provide anything,” Wells said.</p><p class="">Medication abortion, commonly referred to as the abortion pill, is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/evidence-you-can-use/medication-abortion" target="_blank">growing in popularity</a>&nbsp;for earlier abortion care. Even though medication abortion is safe and common (as are procedural abortions), the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/mifeprex-mifepristone-information" target="_blank">U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) mandates</a>&nbsp;that the first pill taken to induce an abortion, mifepristone, must be prescribed by a health-care provider with specific qualifications and can only be dispensed in&nbsp;clinics, medical offices, and hospitals—not at pharmacies. This is a huge barrier: According to&nbsp;the Guttmacher Institute,&nbsp;<a href="https://data.guttmacher.org/states/table?state=US&amp;topics=58&amp;dataset=data" target="_blank">89 percent of counties in the country</a>&nbsp;don’t have an abortion provider.“</p><p class=""><a href="https://rewire.news/article/2020/04/14/self-managed-abortions-may-be-more-difficult-to-access-right-now-heres-what-you-need-to-know/">Read the full article here</a></p>]]></content:encoded><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/55411f70e4b033b0c2b7dc0d/57d57813bebafba39be82312/5e98ba1412f87816e2dd8f39/1587067534113/1500w/pill_1-740x525.jpg" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="740" height="525"><media:title type="plain">REWIRE.NEWS: Self-Managed Abortions May Be More Difficult to Access Right Now&#x2014;Here’s What You Need to Know</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Rewire.News: How to Get an Abortion During the COVID-19 Pandemic</title><dc:creator>Plan C</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 16 Apr 2020 19:52:09 +0000</pubDate><link>https://plancpills.org/press/how-to-get-an-abortion-during-the-covid-19-pandemic</link><guid isPermaLink="false">55411f70e4b033b0c2b7dc0d:57d57813bebafba39be82312:5e98b6c426a98646e6d35513</guid><description><![CDATA[Plan C provides a “report card” on online retailers that offer the

But over the past three decades, as this divide grew, a new technology emerged. It’s now possible to order abortion pills online, which has enabled people in the U.S. to self-manage early abortions outside of a conventional clinic or doctor’s office. With abortion pills, individuals have been able to sidestep the debate altogether—and they’ve become empowered to manage their own health care.&nbsp;</p><p class="">This is a story not everyone knows, but it’s one worth sharing. Just as the Internet has democratized platforms for diverse viewpoints to flourish, it has also democratized information and access to a system for autonomous health care.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="">At<a href="https://plancpills.org/">&nbsp;Plan C</a>, our job is to ensure everyone knows about this new avenue for autonomy.</p><p class="">Today, online access to abortion pills is being led by physician-supported site<a href="http://aidaccess.org/">&nbsp;AidAccess.org</a>, which, despite resistance from the Trump administration,&nbsp;<a href="https://msmagazine.com/2019/05/20/aid-access-will-continue-providing-abortion-care-in-defiance-of-the-fda/">has prescribed and shipped abortion pills to the U.S. for the last two years</a>. Aid Access has worked tirelessly to extend health care into some of the most rural and economically disadvantaged areas in our country under a humanitarian mission to ensure every individual’s right to bodily autonomy and choice.&nbsp;</p><p class="">We estimate that among Aid Access, other online pharmacies and other sources of pills, tens of thousands of Americans self-managed abortions with pills last year. Research also shows that one-third to one-half all abortions within the U.S. medical system are with pills, and that this number is growing.</p><p class="">The truth is, most people in this country still don’t know that abortion pills exist—let alone that they are available online. And those of us who do know may have questions about their history, their safety, their legality or how we can make them more accessible to everyone.</p><p class="">In honor of Roe v. Wade’s 47th anniversary, we released an animated video telling the fascinating history of abortion pills in the U.S.&nbsp;</p><p class="">Abortion access is an issue that disproportionately affects our most marginalized neighbors, keeping them disempowered and in poverty, while people of privilege will always continue find the abortion access they need. We can serve our broader community by amplifying information about the availability of abortion pills online, as well as the legality of self-care.&nbsp;</p><p class="">Sharing this story is an act of freedom over our bodies.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Take Action!</strong></h2><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class=""><strong>Share the video&nbsp;</strong>by email, text or social media.

But researchers say self-managed abortions have risen as abortion has become more restricted in certain states, and as more people have learned that effective pills can be ordered online or purchased across the border.&nbsp;</p><p class="">“This is happening,” said Jill E. Adams, executive director of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ifwhenhow.org/" title="" target="_blank"><span>If/When/How</span></a>: Lawyering for Reproductive Justice, which&nbsp;provides legal assistance to women seeking abortions. “This is an irreversible part of abortion care here in the United States.”</p><p class="">The&nbsp;black market for abortion pills has changed the landscape for those lacking easy access to an abortion clinic or preferring to have an abortion in private. The pills are harder to regulate than in-clinic abortions; they can be easily hidden and shipped, and women can take them at home and appear to have had a spontaneous miscarriage."</p><p class=""><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/20/upshot/abortion-pills-rising-use.html">Read the full article here</a><br></p>]]></content:encoded><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/55411f70e4b033b0c2b7dc0d/57d57813bebafba39be82312/5d886a16e7a89537829436f3/1576047201056/1500w/merlin_71243662_fabbe490-8b73-4cae-9e64-30c06650a645-superJumbo.jpg" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="1000"><media:title type="plain">The New York Times: Why America’s Abortion Rate Might Be Higher Than It Appears</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>NPR: With Abortion Restrictions On The Rise, Some Women Induce Their Own</title><dc:creator>Plan C</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 23 Sep 2019 06:44:28 +0000</pubDate><link>https://plancpills.org/press/https/wwwnprorg/2019/09/19/759761114/with-abortion-restrictions-on-the-rise-some-women-induce-their-own</link><guid isPermaLink="false">55411f70e4b033b0c2b7dc0d:57d57813bebafba39be82312:5d88693614ffd35492b6c427</guid><description><![CDATA[NPR: With Abortion Restrictions On The Rise, Some Women Induce Their Own]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="">"When Arlen found out she was pregnant this year, she was still finishing college and knew she didn't want a child.</p><p class="">There's a clinic near her home, but Arlen faced other obstacles to getting an abortion.</p><p class="">"I started researching about prices, and I was like, 'Well, I don't have $500,' " said Arlen, who is in her 20s and lives in El Paso, Texas.
